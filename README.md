# Numerical_Solution_for_Schrodinger_Equation
The numerical solution of Schrodinger equation project had been done by solve the ordinary and partial differantial equation numerically using finite difference method.
In this project, some one dimensional systems had been solved numerically, the hydrogen atom radial equation had been solved numerically and the hydrogen molecule atom with asmuthal symmetry had been solved.
